Overview of the project
=======================
The project contains a mechanism to generate a meme. It consists of two modes of operation.

The command line based version uses locally stored images to generate a meme using user supplied body text and author name. The meme is stored locally as a file and path to the file is displayed to the user.

The web based version can create a new meme based on user supplied image url, quote and author via a web form.
Alternatively it can generate a random meme from local images, collection of quotes and authors.
The meme is displayed in the web browser.
